# Introduction

Thank you for considering a contribution to LLMCord. This is a passion project I have created so I am the sole maintainer and I appreciate any features, fixes or ideas people have about improving LLMCord.

I created these guidelines to ensure that myself and other contributor's time is respected. In return, we will reciprocate the respect in addressing your contribution.

LLMCord is an open source project and I would love any type of contribution from the community. There are many ways to contribute whether it is a bug fix, feature proposal or a simple spelling error in the documentation.

If you have a support problem create an issue with the `support` tag

## Responsibilies

- Ensure every change is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux

- Create issues for any major changes/enhancements (small things like typos or grammar issues don't need issues. Simply make a PR and I'll most likely merge it)

- Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.

- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.

- Include tests for any new code. Anything related to discord.py such as new commands does not need to be tested

- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

## First contributions

Unsure where to begin contrubuting? Look through any of the `good-first-issue` issues which should require a few lines of code to change. In addition, `help-wanted` issues are great to contribute albeit more complex than `good-first-issue` issues.

Not sure how? Learn [Here](https://makeapullrequest.com/)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first

If you are asked to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting Started

1. Find/create an issue. Once a maintainer has tagged the issue as `open` you can begin. If it is a small change (like a typo) skip to step 2

2. Fork the repo

3. Make your changes

4. Open a PR tagging the issue it's related to and stating all changes that have been made
